### **Explanation of the `LoginView` and `LogoutView`**

#### **LoginView**

- **Purpose**: Handles user authentication and token generation for subsequent API requests.

##### **Code Breakdown**
1. **Serializer Class**: 
   ```python
   serializer_class = CustomUserSerializer
   ```
   This specifies the serializer to use for validating user data, although it is not explicitly used in this method.

2. **Retrieving Credentials**:
   ```python
   username = request.data.get("username")
   password = request.data.get("password")
   ```
   The `POST` request contains the username and password provided by the user.

3. **User Lookup**:
   ```python
   user = CustomUser.objects.filter(username=username).first()
   ```
   - Searches for a user with the given username.
   - Uses `filter` to ensure the query doesn't raise an exception if no user is found.
   - Retrieves the first matching user or `None` if no match exists.

4. **Password Verification**:
   ```python
   if user and user.check_password(password):
   ```
   - Verifies the password using Django's `check_password` method, which compares the hashed password stored in the database with the input.

5. **Login and Token Creation**:
   ```python
   login(request, user)
   token = Token.objects.create(user=user)
   ```
   - Logs in the user by attaching their session to the `request`.
   - Creates a unique authentication token for the user using Django's `Token` model.

6. **Response**:
   ```python
   return Response({'message': 'user logged in', 'token': token.key}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
   ```
   - Returns a success message along with the generated token.
   - This token will be used for authenticating subsequent API requests.

7. **Invalid Credentials**:
   ```python
   return Response({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
   ```
   - If authentication fails, an error response is returned.

#### **LogoutView**

- **Purpose**: Handles token deletion and user logout.

##### **Code Breakdown**
1. **Permission Check**:
   ```python
   permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
   ```
   - Ensures that only authenticated users can access this view.

2. **Token Deletion**:
   ```python
   request.user.auth_token.delete()
   ```
   - Deletes the token associated with the currently authenticated user.
   - This effectively invalidates the user's authentication for future requests.

3. **User Logout**:
   ```python
   logout(request)
   ```
   - Logs the user out by clearing their session.

4. **Response**:
   ```python
   return Response({'message': 'Logged out successfully'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
   ```
   - Returns a success message confirming the logout.

### **Token Mechanism in Login and Logout**

#### **Login**
1. The user provides valid credentials (username and password).
2. A unique token is generated for the user:
   - Stored in the `Token` model with a one-to-one relationship to the user.
   - The token is sent to the client in the response.
3. The client stores the token (e.g., in local storage or memory) and sends it with every API request in the header:
   ```plaintext
   Authorization: Token <token_value>
   ```

#### **Logout**
1. The user sends a logout request with their token.
2. The server identifies the user using the provided token and deletes it from the database:
   - The token becomes invalid, and the user can no longer authenticate using it.
3. The user's session is cleared, ensuring a clean logout.

---

### **Summary**
- **LoginView**:
  - Authenticates the user.
  - Issues a token for API authentication.
- **LogoutView**:
  - Deletes the token, revoking API access.
  - Logs the user out by clearing their session.

This mechanism ensures stateless, secure authentication where the token is the key to accessing protected resources.

To make a request for login using the `LoginView`, the client (such as a frontend application, Postman, or a cURL command) sends a **POST request** with the user's credentials in the request body. 

---

### **Request for Login**

#### **1. Endpoint**
The login endpoint URL is defined in `urls.py`:
```python
path('login/', LoginView.as_view(), name='user-login'),
```
The URL to send the login request might look like:
```plaintext
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/login/
```

#### **2. HTTP Method**
The method for login is **POST**, as defined in the `post` method of the `LoginView` class.

#### **3. Request Headers**
Headers typically include:
- **Content-Type**: `application/json` (if sending JSON data).
- No token is required since this is a public endpoint for unauthenticated users.

Example headers:
```plaintext
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### **4. Request Body**
The request body contains the user's credentials:
```json
{
  "username": "user123",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

---

### **Example Requests**

#### **Using cURL**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username": "user123", "password": "securepassword"}'
```

#### **Using Postman**
1. Set the method to **POST**.
2. Enter the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/`.
3. Go to the **Body** tab:
   - Choose `raw`.
   - Set the body type to JSON.
   - Enter:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "user123",
       "password": "securepassword"
     }
     ```
4. Send the request.

#### **Using JavaScript (Axios)**
```javascript
axios.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/', {
    username: 'user123',
    password: 'securepassword'
})
.then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error(error.response.data);
});
```

---

### **Response for Successful Login**
If the credentials are correct, the server responds with a **200 OK** status and a token in the body:
```json
{
  "message": "user logged in",
  "token": "8951a608c193c5e6bb1b600c77520538aa477bba"
}
```

---

### **Response for Failed Login**
If the credentials are invalid, the server responds with a **400 Bad Request** status and an error message:
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

---

### **What Happens Internally**
1. The server receives the request and extracts the `username` and `password`.
2. It looks up the user in the database using:
   ```python
   user = CustomUser.objects.filter(username=username).first()
   ```
3. If the user exists, it checks the password using:
   ```python
   user.check_password(password)
   ```
4. If authentication is successful:
   - The user is logged in with `login(request, user)`.
   - A token is generated using:
     ```python
     token = Token.objects.create(user=user)
     ```
   - The token is returned in the response.
5. If authentication fails, an error message is returned.

This process securely validates the user's credentials and provides them with a token for future API access.
